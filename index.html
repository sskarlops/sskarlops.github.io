                    <p>Documents obtained by RNZ under the Official Information Act (OIA) show police estimate the harm from alcohol to be about $7.8 billion a year, compared to $1.8 billion for illegal drugs.
                        In an interview with RNZ, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster defended police resourcing of alcohol harm reduction, saying police had limited influence over much of the damage being done.
                        Coster told RNZ that new measures should be considered, including allowing bottle stores to only open during day time hours and raising the price of alcohol.
                        One document, a presentation to the Southern Police District Leadership Team, says the social cost of amphetamines is $365m and so "alcohol causes 21.5 times the harm of meth".
                        But of New Zealand's 10,000 police officers just 84 are Alcohol Harm Prevention Officers (AHPO) - or 0.84 percent of the workforce.Documents obtained by RNZ under the Official Information Act (OIA) show police estimate the harm from alcohol to be about $7.8 billion a year, compared to $1.8 billion for illegal drugs.

                    <h2>Struclural Violence in India</h2>
                    <p>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is extending its support for Ukraine with new funding commitments. At the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Berlin on 11-12 June, the Bank signed multiple financing and pre-financing agreements, which bring the total EBRD financing deployed in wartime Ukraine to €4.5 billion.
                        The Bank has also mobilised new de-risking and risk-sharing tools from the European Union and other development organisations for over €600 million.
                        The EBRD, Ukraine’s largest institutional investor, has significantly increased its finance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale war there, and aims to continue investing between €1.5 to 2 billion in the country annually.  
                        EBRD shareholders have recently agreed to provide a €4 billion paid-in capital increase to enable the Bank to continue investing at these levels in wartime, with the potential for more investments when reconstruction starts.
                        Ukraine is now a candidate for European Union accession. But the Berlin conference comes amid weeks of Russian air attacks on the country’s energy facilities. These have damaged or destroyed more than half of national energy generation capacity and raised questions about how Ukraine will provide many of its citizens with light and heating this winter.</p>
